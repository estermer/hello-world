# hello-world
This is my first repository to learn github

This is my first change to create a commit!

My name is Eric Stermer, I am new to coding and learning to become a professional coder.

I attend a free coding meet up in Lynchburg, Va and work on freecodecamp.com challenges.

I also am attending Liberty University for my second bachelors degree for the BS: Information Technology.
